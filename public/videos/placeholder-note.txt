This directory would contain actual video files in a real application.

For example:
- baggy-magazine-walkthrough.mp4
- baggy-runway-show.mp4
- baggy-behind-the-scenes.mp4

Since we can't create actual video files through this interface, we'll rely on the 
fallback poster images in our components and proper error handling.

When implementing this for real, you would place actual .mp4, .webm, or other 
video format files in this directory.
