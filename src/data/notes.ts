    content: `After a pretty rough last half year, I've been feeling my energy and enthusiasm coming back recently! So I've been spending these past few weeks finally completing some of my personal projects.

Currently still residing in Toronto, though the plan is to move to NYC by the middle of the year. And maybe get a cute little british shorthair (or two!).

Moving to another country would require a visa, which opens up a whole new can of worms on decision-making and future-planning. For someone that hasn't really been thinking of plans beyond the next year, that's absolutely a shift in mindset that I'll need to tackle.

For now though... I'm going to continue focusing on my nearterm goals below and see where that gets me (especially as I continue to get back to - and rediscover - my baseline).

# Current Goals
- spend now - September working on interesting projects that don't need to have a ROI
- prove to myself that I have discipline and focus`,

These pages you're currently reading, these are mainly my /now pages, inspired by Derek Sivers and the [/now movement](https://nownownow.com/about). It's essentially a spot to showcase what I'm up to these days, while keeping historical context on /nows past.

The UI is heavily inspired by [Alana Goyal's](https://www.alanagoyal.com/notes/about-me) personal website which I found super cool.

All the code here was written by AI (blend of o1, claude, cursor, v0)! Wild right?`,
