    content: `After a pretty rough last half year, I've been feeling my energy and enthusiasm coming back recently! So I've been spending these past few weeks finally completing some of my personal projects.

Currently still residing in Toronto, though the plan is to move to NYC by the middle of the year. And maybe get a cute little british shorthair (or two!).

Moving to another country would require a visa, which opens up a whole new can of worms on decision-making and future-planning. For someone that hasn't really been thinking of plans beyond the next year, that's absolutely a shift in mindset that I'll need to tackle.

For now though... I'm going to continue focusing on my nearterm goals below and see where that gets me (especially as I continue to get back to - and rediscover - my baseline).

# Current Goals
- spend now - September working on interesting projects that don't need to have a ROI
- prove to myself that I have discipline and focus`,

The current UI is inspired by [Alana Goyal's](https://www.alanagoyal.com/notes/about-me) personal website, with additional whimsical touches from yours truly ~

All the code here was written with the help of AI cause I don't code... or I guess now I do??`,

    content: `In January, I led a workshop where we made bingo cards (rather than your usual new years resolutions). This is what's on mine, it represents all the things I want to complete (or at least get started on) in in this first half of 2025.

Update: June 2025 - Good amount of stuff done, but I think I should probably create a new bingo card for this next half.
