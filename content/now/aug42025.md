# staying accountable
i have a personal discord i've been using as a to-do list for the past few months. recently i onboarded two of my other "self-employed" friends onto it and it's really been helping them. Heres their unprompted testimonials LOL: 

"Thank you for getting me into the Discord group Helen! It has been great! What I've done this past week was comparable to what I have done last month! That‚Äôs a 400% productivity boost!! ‚ô•Ô∏è"

"After my pilgrimage, I found myself constantly stressed, trying to figure out what I wanted out of life, which felt like an existential crisis. Then Helen came to my rescue. We set up a simple chat where we added our daily to-dos, and that transformed how I approached every day."

Having them here has also really helped me tho so it's a win-win! 

# current mood: indecisive as usual, yet positive 
things are good, chugging along, excited for the future. here's to an abundance mindset for you reader, as well!
