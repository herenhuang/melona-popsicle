made it to NYC!! am currently in the mood to just enjoy the hot builder summer and push back job searching for now. maybe i build conviction in something else instead? or maybe not???

# random things that have happened since last update 
- interviewed for a16z speedrun with a friend (didn't get accepted this time, but it was fun!)
- went to a reddit games hackathon and won a lil bag 
- played 900-person musical chairs in bryant park
- picked up what I thought was a piece of popcorn but it was really a cockroach egg (don't ask me how I know lol)

# building with ai
The month-long Bolt Hackathon is prob the biggest to-do on my list right now. I have a bunch of ideas, and I just know there's enough time to execute them all. What's harder though is keeping up the momentum and motivation. But currently I'm working on another 
Reddit game, and then I have this flight anxiety app I'm hoping to actually ship. 

# searching for that next thing
I'm still jumping on interesting opportunities, but I realized that the whole 'sit-in-front-of-the-TV-and-mass-submit-my-resume" route is not it for me. I'm landing (some) interviews, but I'm losing interest in the process, and when that happens
 I question whether I'm still doing the right thing. So I'll probbaly transition to just chatting with folks, connecting with talent peeps at VC firms, and narrowing down exactly what it is I want to do next if it's not working for myself.

# tackling FOMO 
They all say NYC is a city that moves fast, and there's endless amounts of things to do. But what happens when the thing you want to do is just sit at home? But what am I really sitting at home doing? What if there's all these opportunities out there and it's my fault for not
 seeking them out, or taking advantage. I'm spending $$$ here... and this is how I choose to spend my time? But if I'm not sitting in front of my computer executing... something, then what is there really for me to do?

# current mood: indecisive as usual 
But the good thing is I am choosing to be happy (and patient) with said indecision. One day there's going to be a decision and I'll look back on these notes and be like "oh man, remember when I spent those few months bunming around and doing whatever the heck? Those were great times!"
