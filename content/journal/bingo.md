In January, I led a workshop where we made bingo cards (rather than your usual new years resolutions). This is what's on mine, it represents all the things I want to complete (or at least get started on) in in this first half of 2025.

Update: June 2025 - Good amount of stuff done, but I think I should probably create a new bingo card for this next half.
